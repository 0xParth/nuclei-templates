  name: VPC Flow Logs Not Enabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: low
  description: |
    Ensures Amazon VPC Flow Logs are enabled for tracking network traffic to and from VPCs, aiding in security and troubleshooting.
  impact: |
    Without VPC Flow Logs, detecting abnormal traffic patterns or breaches becomes difficult, increasing risk of undetected threats.
  remediation: |
    Enable VPC Flow Logs in the AWS Management Console under the VPC dashboard to collect data on IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
